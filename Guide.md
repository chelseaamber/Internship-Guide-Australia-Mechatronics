## Internship ideas + links to apply + information üíª
I've seen a lot of Software Engineering internship lists available on github (which makes sense) however as someone more interested in the interaction between code and mechanical / electrical components I wanted to create a more Mechatronics focus reference list. 
I am currently in my second year of Engineering at Monash and not looking to apply for internships anytime soon. However, idealising my long-term goals is a realistic source of motivation + inspiration for me, hence this list!
as Mechatronics is a mix of Electrical, Mechanical and Software concepts, I have split the list into these categories - although ideally we'd like one that incorporates all of them.

* BoM
* Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)
* Department of Defence (have a graduate program online)
