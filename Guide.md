## Internship ideas + links to apply + information üíª
I am currently in my second year of Engineering at Monash and not looking to apply for internships anytime soon. 
However, idealising my long-term goals is a realistic source of motivation + inspiration for me, hence this list!
Mechatronics is a mix of Electrical, Mechanical and Software concepts, so I have split the list into these categories - although ideally I'd like one that incorporates all of them.
